      Editor:

For a number of years I have been familiar with the observation that the
quality of programmers is a decreasing function of the density of *go
to* statements in the programs they produce. More recently I discovered
why the use of the *go to* statement has such disastrous effects, and I
became convinced that the *go to* statement should be abolished from all
"higher level" programming languages (i.e. everything except, perhaps,
plain machine code). At that time I did not attach too much importance
to this discovery; I now submit my considerations for publication
because in very recent discussions in which the subject turned up, I
have been urged to do so.

My first remark is that, although the programmer's activity ends when he
has constructed a correct program, the process taking place under
control of his program is the true subject matter of his activity, for
it is this process that has to accomplish the desired effect; it is this
process that in its dynamic behavior has to satisfy the desired
specifications. Yet, once the program has been made, the "making' of the
corresponding process is delegated to the machine.

My second remark is that our intellectual powers are rather geared to
master static relations and that our powers to visualize processes
evolving in time are relatively poorly developed. For that reason we
should do (as wise programmers aware of our limitations) our utmost to
shorten the conceptual gap between the static program and the dynamic
process, to make the correspondence between the program (spread out in
text space) and the process (spread out in time) as trivial as possible.

Let us now consider how we can characterize the progress of a process.
(You may think about this question in a very concrete manner: suppose
that a process, considered as a time succession of actions, is stopped
after an arbitrary action, what data do we have to fix in order that we
can redo the process until the very same point?) If the program text is
a pure concatenation of, say, assignment statements (for the purpose of
this discussion regarded as the descriptions of single actions) it is
sufficient to point in the program text to a point between two
successive action descriptions. (In the absence of *go to* statements I
can permit myself the syntactic ambiguity in the last three words of the
previous sentence: if we parse them as "successive (action
descriptions)" we mean successive in text space; if we parse as
"(successive action) descriptions" we mean successive in time.) Let us
call such a pointer to a suitable place in the text a "textual index."

When we include conditional clauses (*if* /B/ *then* /A/), alternative
clauses (*if* /B/ *then* /A/1 *else* /A/2), choice clauses as introduced
by C. A. R. Hoare (case[i] of (/A/1, /A/2,，，，, /An/)),or conditional
expressions as introduced by J. McCarthy (/B/1 -> /E/1, /B/2 -> /E/2,
，，，, /Bn/ -> /En/), the fact remains that the progress of the process
remains characterized by a single textual index.

As soon as we include in our language procedures we must admit that a
single textual index is no longer sufficient. In the case that a textual
index points to the interior of a procedure body the dynamic progress is
only characterized when we also give to which call of the procedure we
refer. With the inclusion of procedures we can characterize the progress
of the process via a sequence of textual indices, the length of this
sequence being equal to the dynamic depth of procedure calling.

Let us now consider repetition clauses (like, *while* /B/ *repeat* /A/
or *repeat* /A/ *until* /B/). Logically speaking, such clauses are now
superfluous, because we can express repetition with the aid of recursive
procedures. For reasons of realism I don't wish to exclude them: on the
one hand, repetition clauses can be implemented quite comfortably with
present day finite equipment; on the other hand, the reasoning pattern
known as "induction" makes us well equipped to retain our intellectual
grasp on the processes generated by repetition clauses. With the
inclusion of the repetition clauses textual indices are no longer
sufficient to describe the dynamic progress of the process. With each
entry into a repetition clause, however, we can associate a so-called
"dynamic index," inexorably counting the ordinal number of the
corresponding current repetition. As repetition clauses (just as
procedure calls) may be applied nestedly, we find that now the progress
of the process can always be uniquely characterized by a (mixed)
sequence of textual and/or dynamic indices.

The main point is that the values of these indices are outside
programmer's control; they are generated (either by the write-up of his
program or by the dynamic evolution of the process) whether he wishes or
not. They provide independent coordinates in which to describe the
progress of the process.

Why do we need such independent coordinates? The reason is - and this
seems to be inherent to sequential processes - that we can interpret the
value of a variable only with respect to the progress of the process. If
we wish to count the number, /n/ say, of people in an initially empty
room, we can achieve this by increasing /n/ by one whenever we see
someone entering the room. In the in-between moment that we have
observed someone entering the room but have not yet performed the
subsequent increase of /n/, its value equals the number of people in the
room minus one!

The unbridled use of the *go to* statement has an immediate consequence
that it becomes terribly hard to find a meaningful set of coordinates in
which to describe the process progress. Usually, people take into
account as well the values of some well chosen variables, but this is
out of the question because it is relative to the progress that the
meaning of these values is to be understood! With the *go to* statement
one can, of course, still describe the progress uniquely by a counter
counting the number of actions performed since program start (viz. a
kind of normalized clock). The difficulty is that such a coordinate,
although unique, is utterly unhelpful. In such a coordinate system it
becomes an extremely complicated affair to define all those points of
progress where, say, /n/ equals the number of persons in the room minus
one!

The *go to* statement as it stands is just too primitive; it is too much
an invitation to make a mess of one's program. One can regard and
appreciate the clauses considered as bridling its use. I do not claim
that the clauses mentioned are exhaustive in the sense that they will
satisfy all needs, but whatever clauses are suggested (e.g. abortion
clauses) they should satisfy the requirement that a programmer
independent coordinate system can be maintained to describe the process
in a helpful and manageable way.

It is hard to end this with a fair acknowledgment. Am I to judge by whom
my thinking has been influenced? It is fairly obvious that I am not
uninfluenced by Peter Landin and Christopher Strachey. Finally I should
like to record (as I remember it quite distinctly) how Heinz Zemanek at
the pre-ALGOL meeting in early 1959 in Copenhagen quite explicitly
expressed his doubts whether the *go to* statement should be treated on
equal syntactic footing with the assignment statement. To a modest
extent I blame myself for not having then drawn the consequences of his
remark

The remark about the undesirability of the *go to* statement is far from
new. I remember having read the explicit recommendation to restrict the
use of the *go to* statement to alarm exits, but I have not been able to
trace it; presumably, it has been made by C. A. R. Hoare. In [1, Sec.
3.2.1.] Wirth and Hoare together make a remark in the same direction in
motivating the case construction: "Like the conditional, it mirrors the
dynamic structure of a program more clearly than *go to* statements and
switches, and it eliminates the need for introducing a large number of
labels in the program."

In [2] Guiseppe Jacopini seems to have proved the (logical)
superfluousness of the *go to* statement. The exercise to translate an
arbitrary flow diagram more or less mechanically into a jump-less one,
however, is not to be recommended. Then the resulting flow diagram
cannot be expected to be more transparent than the original one.
